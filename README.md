# Hello, I'm Tiago Patricio!

** A raspy low register voice speaks **

From the coveted country of Portugal to the Indic ocean surrounded continent of Australia and back, rises a descendent of the Ancient Rome Aristocracy members.

Wielding his many talents and attributes such as honor, passion, resilience and a bloody good singing voice he makes way though the challenges and hardships presented before him.

Many have passed and surely many more shall come but the 3 headed beast at hand at this time is one of its kind, mostly constituted of debugging, configuration docs and uncaught exception, nonetheless an unworthy opponent in the presence of a caffeinated beverage of some sort.

And just like so, he carries on at full throttle seeking the fulfillment of his destiny..
