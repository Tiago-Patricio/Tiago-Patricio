Hi, I'm Tiago Patr√≠cio. I am a junior full-stack developer.

I attended Academia de Codigo, where I studied full-stack development for an immersive and intensive 14-weeks Bootcamp. Also, I was the class president for the 49th class in 2020.

Here you can find all the personal projects I developed and projects developed for academic purposes.
